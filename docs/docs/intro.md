# Introduction

Tally Arbiter is software that allows you to combine incoming tally data from multiple sources or video switchers such as Ross Carbonite (through the TSL 3.1 protocol), Blackmagic ATEM or VideoHub, OBS Studio, VMix, etc. and arbitrate the bus state across all of the sources so that devices like cameras can accurately reflect tally data coming from those multiple locations without each device having to be connected to all sources simultaneously.


## Features
* Supports many different tally sources/switchers
* Supports output of tally data to several different types (web/phone, blink(1) USB light, relay, GPO, M5StickC/Arduino)
* Outgoing webhooks, TCP messages, or OSC based on tally states
* Unlimited tally sources and devices
* Cloud Support - send data from your closed production network to a server in the cloud
* Feedbacks and Control through Bitfocus Companion - view tally data live on your stream deck!
* Emulates a VMix Server, making it compatible with your favorite VMix Tally Client
* Send Messages from the Server to supported clients
